# carfax

I used the landing page template from a previous project and popluted with information from:
https://www.carfax.com/vehicle-history-reports/ and https://www.carfaxonline.com/landingPage

I had to adjust colors and add links to images. The purpose of this project was to have a landing page for an actual/product or service.
And in doing so, I got more practice with HTML and CSS. 

I reduced the webpage to something similar because HTML emails aren't meant to be as long as a webpage. Users don't have as much patience
to keep reading a long page of text, even if it is filled with cool designs and images to deals. 



I used emofrigy to create 2index.html which just converts styles.css to inline css.

The output doesn't look the same (or as great in a few spots) in firefox.
